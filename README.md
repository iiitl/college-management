For this we will need a auth page in frontend and two endpoints in backend one to authenticate the user and second to assign them a role after verifying the profile. We also need to store all these info in the database so that the user can login using their credentials on subsequent visits.

   * Database management: Database management is a critical aspect of the College Management Website project as it involves storing, retrieving, and managing the data related to students, faculty, courses, attendance, grades, assignments and other relevant information. An efficient and secure database management system is crucial for the smooth functioning of the website.
